        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am Oosman Khwaja and I am a Multimedia Design and Development
          student at Humber Polytechnic. I have an interest in becoming a UX/UI
          Designer and learning more about the profession. As time goes on, I
          have gotten better at creating user experiences and utilizing Figma in
          order to create that experience.

        <p>
          My journey into this field began when I started noticing how certain
          apps and websites felt more intuitive and enjoyable to use than
          others. This curiosity led me to explore the world of design, where I
          quickly realized the importance of user experience in shaping digital
          products. As I deepened my understanding, I became fascinated by how
          small design choices could significantly impact user interactions.
          Over time, I developed my skills in wireframing, prototyping, and
          usability testing, with Figma becoming my go-to tool for bringing
          ideas to life.

        <p>
          Beyond technical skills, my approach to design is rooted in
          empathy—ensuring that every interface is accessible, visually
          appealing, and easy to navigate. I strive to create experiences that
          not only look good but also feel seamless and intuitive. As I continue
          to grow in this field, I aim to collaborate with diverse teams, learn
          from industry professionals, and contribute to projects that make a
          meaningful impact. My goal is to design digital experiences that
          enhance people’s daily lives while constantly pushing myself to
          improve and innovate.
